### Qtech_task

From my understanding this is a travelling salesman Problem. TSP is known as a NP hard problem. I used a existing python library to solve this problem. It uses dynamic programming to 
solve the problem in short runtime as we know with high number of nodes the runtime of TSP increases exponentially.
